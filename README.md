## 💡 How It Works

The strength of the password is evaluated based on the following rules:

* Minimum length of 8 characters
* Contains lowercase letters (`a-z`)
* Contains uppercase letters (`A-Z`)
* Includes numbers (`0-9`)
* Includes special characters (`!@#$%^&*`, etc.)

Strength levels:

| Strength Score | Label    | Color     |
| -------------- | -------- | --------- |
| 0-2            | Weak     | 🔴 Red    |
| 3-4            | Moderate | 🟠 Orange |
| 5              | Strong   | 🟢 Green  |
